Business Catalyst JavaScript Collection
==========

This is a JavScript collection we at http://www.twoblokeswithapostie.com want to share with Business Catalyst community. Please feel free to contribute.

For now, the only file in this repo is functions.js. We'll introduce more as we go along.

You need to add jQuery to the head of your document before linking this file. Here's a Google hosted link:

```javascript
<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
```
